# TenJS
##### A library for getting all numbers from zero to ten.

## How to use
1. Install
```
$ npm install tenjs
```
2. Import
```
const { ONE, TWO, ... } = require('tenjs');
```
3. Profit.

## Motivation
My motivation behind this project was that I always thought typing out all numbers was really tedious and I could do better. This is why I created this package.
