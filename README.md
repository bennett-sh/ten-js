# TenJS
##### A library for getting all numbers from zero to ten.

## How to use
1. Install
```$ npm install tenjs```
2. Import
```const { ONE, TWO, ... } = require('tenjs');```
3. Profit.

## Motivation
My motivation behind this project was that I always thought typing out all numbers was really annoying and I could do it in a better way so I created this package.
